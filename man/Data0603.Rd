\title{
Data of simulation of random Sierpinski-Carpet with [p,p,p,q]-model and p = 0.6 and q = 0.3
}
\description{
This dataset results of a simulation on the basis of Sierpinski-Carpet with a [p,p,p,q]-model with fixed values of p = 0.6 and q = 0.3. Data was simulated in JAVA and every cell of data is filled with either zeros or ones. It is a simulation example for breast mammography screenings where the result is a black and white picture and values zero and ones stand for black and white.

\usage{data(Data0603)}
\format{
  A data frame with 81 observations on the following 81 variables. These 81 variables result from 3^4, which means fourth ramification of Sierpinski-Carpet.
